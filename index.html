                <p>Hello, I am Derrick, a year 2 student currently studying in Republic Polytechnic pursuing a course in Diploma in Digital Design and Development(DDDD).
                   Throughout this two years, I have acquired a certain amount of knowledge and skills during my time in studying and I aspire to be a UI/UX designer in future.
                   In my own free time, I am a gamer and sometimes playing badminton with family.
